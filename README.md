# Lstm_Lyrics_Gen
Lyrics Generation using LSTM
Train a neural net to generate lyrics based on the provided melody.

During the training of the model I used both to the lyrics of a song and its melody.

The melodies are stored in .mid (MIDI files) and contain various types of information â€“ notes, the instruments used etc. 

## The network Architecture :

## Sampling

Word generation was not deterministic. Using a softmax function on the probobilities from 'word_model.most_similar(positive=[np.array(pred)],topn=10)) the next word is  sampled.
